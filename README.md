# Tomato-disease-detection-using-CNN
Basic CNN model for detecting disease of tomato.
The dataset contains 10 different classes of tomato leaves, one healthy and 9 for different diseases, such as mosaic virus, yellow leaf curl virus, etc.
The main goal is to build a basic CNN model that will detect diseases in the leaves.
